Bucketing Validation Script

This script runs comprehensive validation tests to ensure that:
1. First forecast bucket starts on the analysis date
2. All buckets (historic and forecast) follow on directly from each other
3. All buckets are exactly the risk period length (from product master)
4. No gaps or overlaps between buckets

This should be run as part of the forecasting pipeline to validate bucketing logic.
