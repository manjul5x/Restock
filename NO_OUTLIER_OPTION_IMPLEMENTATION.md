# No Outlier Option Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the "no" outlier option that allows users to disable outlier detection and capping for specific products in the product master.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Master Schema (`restock/forecaster/data/product_master_schema.py`)

**Updated the `ProductMasterRecord` class:**
- Modified the `outlier_method` field description to include 'no' as an option
- Updated description: `"Outlier detection method: 'iqr', 'zscore', 'mad', 'rolling', 'no'"`

### 2. Outlier Handler (`restock/forecaster/outlier/handler.py`)

**Updated `_detect_high_outliers_only` method:**
- Added handling for `method == 'no'` case
- Returns a Series of all `False` values when outlier detection is disabled
- This ensures no outliers are detected when the "no" option is used

**Updated `_get_upper_threshold` method:**
- Added handling for `method == 'no'` case
- Returns `float('inf')` when outlier capping is disabled
- This ensures no capping occurs when the "no" option is used

### 3. Documentation Updates

**Customer Data Guide (`restock/CUSTOMER_DATA_GUIDE.md`):**
- Updated outlier_method description to include 'no' option
- Added example with 'no' outlier method in the CSV example

**Product Master Creation Example (`restock/examples/create_customer_product_master.py`):**
- Updated comments to mention 'no' as an available option
- Added documentation about available outlier methods

### 4. Dummy Data Generator (`restock/forecaster/data/dummy/generate_product_master.py`)

**Updated both daily and weekly product master generation:**
- Added 'no' to the `outlier_methods` list
- This ensures that some dummy products will use the "no" outlier option for testing

## How It Works

### When `outlier_method = 'no'`:

1. **No Outlier Detection**: The `_detect_high_outliers_only` method returns all `False` values
2. **No Outlier Capping**: The `_get_upper_threshold` method returns `float('inf')`
3. **All Data Preserved**: All demand data points are kept in the cleaned data
4. **No Outlier Records**: No records are created in the outlier data

### Example Usage:

```csv
product_id,location_id,product_category,demand_frequency,risk_period,forecast_window_length,forecast_horizon,outlier_method,outlier_threshold
PROD_001,LOC_001,Electronics,d,7,100,10,iqr,1.5
PROD_002,LOC_002,Clothing,d,7,80,8,zscore,2.0
PROD_003,LOC_003,Food,d,7,60,5,no,1.5
```

In this example:
- `PROD_001` uses IQR outlier detection
- `PROD_002` uses Z-score outlier detection  
- `PROD_003` uses no outlier detection (all data preserved)

## Testing

The implementation was tested with a comprehensive test script that verified:

1. **"No" Option Works**: When `outlier_method = 'no'`, all data points are preserved
2. **Regular Options Still Work**: Existing outlier detection methods (iqr, zscore, mad, rolling) continue to function
3. **Pipeline Compatibility**: The changes don't break existing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can choose to disable outlier detection for specific products
2. **Data Preservation**: Critical data points are not lost due to outlier detection
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality remains unchanged
4. **Easy Configuration**: Simple setting in product master file

## Impact on Pipeline

- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality remains intact
- **Enhanced Options**: Users now have more control over outlier handling
- **Consistent Interface**: The same product master format is used
- **Performance**: No performance impact as the "no" option is a simple bypass

## Usage Recommendations

- Use `outlier_method = 'no'` for products where:
  - All demand data is considered valid
  - Outliers represent real business events
  - Data quality is high and outliers are rare
  - Historical patterns show that "outliers" are actually normal events

- Continue using other methods (iqr, zscore, mad, rolling) for products where:
  - Outlier detection is important for forecasting accuracy
  - Data quality issues are common
  - Outliers represent data errors rather than real demand
