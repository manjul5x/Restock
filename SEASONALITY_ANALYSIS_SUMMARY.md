# Prophet Seasonality Analysis Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive seasonality analysis system has been implemented for the Prophet forecasting model in the demand visualization dashboard. This system provides detailed analysis of Fourier terms, seasonality strength assessment, and intelligent recommendations for model optimization.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔍 Comprehensive Fourier Term Analysis
- **Fourier Term Calculation**: Analyzes Fourier series coefficients for each seasonality component
- **Magnitude Analysis**: Calculates max, mean, and standard deviation of Fourier term magnitudes
- **Significant Terms Detection**: Identifies Fourier terms with magnitude > 0.01
- **Strength Classification**: Categorizes seasonality as VERY_STRONG, STRONG, MODERATE, WEAK, or VERY_WEAK

### 📊 Seasonality Components Analyzed
- **Yearly Seasonality**: Annual patterns (365.25 days, Fourier order 10)
- **Quarterly Seasonality**: Business cycle patterns (91.25 days, Fourier order 8)
- **Monthly Seasonality**: Monthly patterns (30.5 days, Fourier order 5)
- **Weekly Seasonality**: Weekly patterns (7 days, Fourier order 3)
- **Daily Seasonality**: Daily patterns (1 day, Fourier order 4)

### 🎯 Intelligent Recommendations
- **Regularization Detection**: Identifies when seasonality_prior_scale should be reduced
- **Component Selection**: Suggests which seasonalities to include/exclude
- **Parameter Optimization**: Recommends optimal prior scales for changepoints, seasonality, and holidays
- **Feature Selection**: Advises when multiple strong seasonalities are detected

### 🛠️ Automatic Model Optimization
- **Dynamic Regularization**: Automatically applies regularization settings when needed
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Updates model parameters based on analysis results
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where seasonality analysis fails

## Technical Implementation

### Fourier Analysis Algorithm
```python

    # Convert dates to numeric
    t = (dates - dates.min()).dt.total_seconds() / (24 * 3600)
    
    # Calculate Fourier terms
    fourier_terms = np.zeros(2 * fourier_order)
    for k in range(1, fourier_order + 1):
        # Cosine term
        cos_term = np.cos(2 * np.pi * k * t / period)
        fourier_terms[2 * k - 2] = np.mean(cos_term * data['y'])
        
        # Sine term
        sin_term = np.sin(2 * np.pi * k * t / period)
        fourier_terms[2 * k - 1] = np.mean(sin_term * data['y'])
    
    return fourier_terms
```

### Strength Classification
```python
def _determine_seasonality_strength(self, max_magnitude):
    if max_magnitude > 0.5: return "VERY_STRONG"
    elif max_magnitude > 0.2: return "STRONG"
    elif max_magnitude > 0.1: return "MODERATE"
